# Digital-Signal-Processing-Toolbox

This project is a MATLAB-based Digital Signal Processing (DSP) toolbox that provides essential audio and image processing functions. The toolbox includes basic signal manipulation, visualization, and an extended feature that explores advanced DSP techniques.

Features:
Audio Processing Functions

    Loading & Saving: Supports WAV, FLAC, and OGG formats for reading and writing audio files.

    Signal Visualization: Displays waveforms in both time and frequency domains.

    Playback Control: Allows users to play audio with adjustable volume settings.

    Equalization: Implements an 11-band equalizer using IIR/FIR filtering techniques.

Image Processing Functions

    Loading & Saving: Reads and writes PNG and JPG image files.

    Image Visualization: Displays images in spatial and frequency domains.

    Segmentation: Performs foreground-background segmentation using custom algorithms.
